Visit the webpage: [https://genuimeetshci.github.io/chi26-workshop/](https://genuimeetshci.github.io/chi26-workshop/)

### Design Concept

Resemble the genUI chat interface:

- a brief answer with an expanded panel for details: UI over the detailed content
- the message and UI would support synced highlighting

---

### Development

Run the local development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Deployment

Deploy to `https://genuimeetshci.github.io/chi26-workshop/`:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This automatically builds and publishes to the `gh-pages` branch.
